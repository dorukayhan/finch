Here's a bunch of stuff made for [Finch](https://www.birdbraintechnologies.com/finch/).
---
When you import the projects and stop there, you'll end up with broken build paths and code consequently refusing to compile. To fix that:

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/dorukayhan/finch/releases)
2. Download and extract finch.zip
3. Find finch.jar and import it as an Eclipse user library named "Finch"
